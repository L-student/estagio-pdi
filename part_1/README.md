### Day 1 Practice

#### Setting up the Environment

Begin by setting up the project environment and verifying that all necessary packages are installed.

#### Project Structure and DVC Setup

Create the following directory structure for the project:

```
project_root/
├── data/
│   └── license_plates/
├── src/
│   ├── preprocess.py
│   ├── ocr.py
│   └── evaluate.py
├── .dvc/
├── .gitignore
├── dvc.yaml
└── requirements.txt
```

Initialize DVC and add the dataset to version control.

#### Implementing Traditional OCR Pipeline

Implement OCR processing steps using OpenCV and scikit-image in the `src` directory:
- `preprocess.py`: For image preprocessing (e.g., grayscale conversion, noise reduction, thresholding).
- `ocr.py`: For character segmentation and recognition.
- `evaluate.py`: For calculating accuracy and visualizing results.

#### Running and Tracking Experiments with Guild AI

Define and run experiments using DvC by setting up `dvc.yaml` and running different configurations.

#### Homework

- Experiment with different preprocessing techniques (e.g., edge detection, different thresholding methods)
- Implement and test a template matching approach for character recognition
- Try machine learning models
- Track all experiments using DvC
