### Day 2 Practice

#### Advanced DVC Usage

Use DVC to create data pipelines and manage different versions of datasets.

#### Defining Hyperparameter Spaces in DvC

Set up hyperparameter tuning experiments in `guild.yml` and run optimization using DvC.

#### Running a Hyperparameter Tuning Experiment

Use DVC to run tuning experiments with optimizers and analyze the results.

#### Analyzing and Visualizing Results

Analyze experiment results and visualize them using DVC.

#### Homework

- Implement a full pipeline for license plate recognition, including plate detection and character segmentation
- Use DVC to version different preprocessing pipelines
- Run a larger tuning experiment (at least 30 trials) using DVC
- Prepare a report analyzing:
  - The impact of different preprocessing techniques and OCR parameters
  - The best-performing configuration
  - Suggestions for further improvement using machine learning techniques
